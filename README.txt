I've packaged up the .Java and .class files into a ready-to-go IntelliJ project.  Most likely you'll be working in Scheduler.java and TCB.java. 

Remember to save separate copies of your work for Part 1, Part 2, etc.  Even if you're not required to hand in each file it'll help you out in the event that you need to go back and re-examine some work that you did for another part.
